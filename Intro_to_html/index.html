        <h1>What are Crystals?</h1>
        <p>Crystals are a natural forming solid materials. The contents of a crystals consist of materials such as atoms, molecules, or ions arranged in a highly ordered micropscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice.
            A lattice-like structure refers to an arrangement where elements are interconnected in a repeating grid. There are seven crystal structures including cubic, monoclinic, trigonal, tetragonal, triclinic, hexagonal, and orthorhombic

          <h2>How Do Crystals Form?</h2>
          <img src="https://hawkhouse.net/cdn/shop/collections/1_51e012ef-a8a1-4a7a-9033-6ad6189b1fd6.png?v=1706535442" alt="Amethyst">
          <p>Crystals grow when alike molecules get close and stick together. This forms a chemical bond that is similar to velcro. Crystals require special conditions to start the growing process such as the right temperatures, molecules and a nucleation site.
            A nucleation site is crutial for cystal formation. This is where the crystal formation process begins. This is when the inital cluster of atoms/molecules start to form. Once a nucleation site is established, it is then allowing the crystal to grow further by adding more molecules to the existing nucleous.
