            <img src="images/bella-edward3.jpg" alt="Bella-Edward">
            <p>"Eclipse," the third installment in Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" series, has garnered a spectrum of reviews since its release. Many readers appreciate the novel's fast-paced plot and deeper character development, particularly the backstories of Rosalie and Jasper, which add depth to the vampire lore. However, some critics point out that the narrative is bogged down by excessive teenage drama and a protracted middle section, which may deter readers not already invested in the series. The portrayal of the love triangle among Bella, Edward, and Jacob has also been a focal point, with discussions about the dynamics and implications of their relationships. Despite these critiques, "Eclipse" achieved significant commercial success, selling over 150,000 copies on its first day and maintaining a strong presence on bestseller lists.</p>

<aside class= "text-container"><h2>☆♡ Breaking Dawn ♡☆</h2>
            <p>"Breaking Dawn," the concluding novel of Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" series, has elicited a spectrum of critical responses. Some reviewers commend its thrilling blend of action, romance, and drama, noting that the strong romantic narrative binds the story together. Others appreciate the humor and emotional depth, with readers expressing laughter and tears throughout the narrative. However, critiques have been directed at the book's length and certain plot elements, with some suggesting that the extensive content might have been better suited for two separate volumes. Additionally, aspects of the storyline have been described as chaotic and outrageous, leading to mixed feelings among readers. Despite these varied opinions, "Breaking Dawn" remains a significant and polarizing conclusion to the beloved saga.</p>

            <h2>☆♡ Midnight Sun ♡☆</h2>
            <img src="images/forks.jpg" alt="Forks">
            <p>"Midnight Sun," the companion novel to Twilight told from Edward Cullen’s perspective, received a mix of praise and criticism from readers and critics alike. Fans appreciated the deeper insight into Edward’s thoughts, emotions, and struggles, which added more complexity to his character and provided a fresh perspective on the original story. Many enjoyed the expanded world-building and additional details that weren’t included in Twilight. However, some critics felt that the book was overly long and repetitive, with Edward’s internal monologue being overly brooding and self-loathing. While it was a treat for longtime Twilight fans, others found it didn’t offer enough new material to justify its length. Despite mixed reviews, the book was a commercial success, proving that the Twilight fandom remains strong years after the original series ended.</p>
