            <p>"Ritual + Remedy was born as space to provide seekers a safe haven to find the tools needed to explore one's own spiritual journey, whatever that may look like. The power of awareness, intuition and connection to self lives within us all and there is no wrong or right way discover that. Whether it be through rituals of reflection, meditation or yoga, observing the cycles of the body, or the seasons of the earth as well as the phases of the moon and and surrounding universe. These rituals, whatever they are, can be the remedies to heal our bodies and souls and we are honored to hold space and offer guidance." (My personal favorite crystal shop in the area)</p>
